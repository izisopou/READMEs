Go to https://ca.cern.ch/ca/
Click on "New Grid User certificate"
Create a new certificate adding a password and click "Get Grid User certificate" 
This will download a myCertificate.p12 file.

To add it to your browser (instructions will be for Firefox but similar steps can be followed for any browser):
Click "Settings"
Click "Privacy & Security"
Click "View cerificates"
If you have any older certificates delete them and then click "Import". Choose the myCertificate.p12 file and add the password you have given.
This allows you to have access to DAS and similar CMS sites from now on.

To add it to LXPLUS:
cd $HOME/.globus/
Inside this directory there should be a usercert.pem and a userkey.pem file if you previously had an older certificate. Otherwise it will probably be empty.
If the usercert.pem, userkey.pem exist delete them.
Put the myCertificate.p12 file inside this directory and then do:

openssl pkcs12 -in myCertificate.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem
openssl pkcs12 -in myCertificate.p12 -nocerts -out $HOME/.globus/userkey.pem

You will be asked to insert your passwords in the commands above.

With the above commands new usercert.pem, userkey.pem files will be created.

Then do:

chmod 600 userkey.pem
chmod 600 usercert.pem

Delete the myCertificate.p12 file to avoid security issues.

This allows you to do "voms-proxy-init -voms cms" and be able to run jobs on grid in LXPLUS.
